      <h2>Dear Dev,</h2>

      <p>
        We're so glad you're a part of the Ham It 2 Me family! We really need your help with some things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our users have been complaining about the user profile page. It is truly a mess! We need you to filter 
        any data customers don't need to see, like null values, from the 'userData' data structure. Customers need 
        to see the following data in order:
        <ul>
          <li>Username</li>
          <li>Join Date</li>
          <li>Past Orders (as a list that includes Order Number, Date and Total)</li>
        </ul>
        Please do not modify the original userData data structure! We need it...for things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our users have also been complaining that they can't export their order histories as a file. Although they 
        can see all of their orders, they can't save it as a spreadsheet. We have another developer who is 
        great at converting data structures to spreadsheets, but we need you to convert the data on the orders 
        page into an appropriate data structure first. Please do the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Place all of the data into a data structure</li>
          <li>Display that data structure in the div with class 'result'</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, our codebase is looking a little dated. There are traditional function definitions everywhere! As much 
        as we love being hipster hammies with a love of all things old school, we need you to choose one of the JavaScript 
        files and: 
        <ul> 
          <li>Convert every function definition to a function expression</li>
          <li>Make sure the webpage still works</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, since you're new, our lead developer wants you to prove yourself a little bit by doing something for 
        no real reason. We're sorry it has come to this, but keeping all of our staff happy is a difficult balance. 
        We kindly ask that you:
        <ul>
          <li>Convert two functions to arrow functions</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you so much for all of your help! <br><br>
        With Love From the Entire Ham It 2 Me Family!!*<br>
